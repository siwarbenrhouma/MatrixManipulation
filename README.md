This is a Java interface for performing basic linear algebra calculations, including:

Matrix multiplication (matrix-matrix and matrix-vector) Matrix transpose Matrix inverse System resolution using direct methods (LU decomposition, Gaussian elimination with/without pivoting, Gaussian elimination (Jordan method), Cholesky decomposition) and iterative methods (Gaussian elimination, Jacobi iteration) This project aims to provide a flexible and easy-to-use interface for developers working with numerical algorithms.

Features

-Supports dense and sparse matrices and so many other types such as (Symmetric ones /definite positive ).

-Optimized algorithms for banded matrices (lower and upper) and triangular matrices to improve performance.

-Provides efficient matrix multiplication implementation -Offers both direct and iterative methods for system resolution with an improved performance.
